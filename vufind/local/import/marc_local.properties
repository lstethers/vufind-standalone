# Uncomment the following lines to track history of indexing times for RSS feeds,
# OAI-PMH server and other updates.  The parameter to these functions must be the
# same fieldspec as the id setting above!
# IMPORTANT: Indexing this extra information will make extra database calls during
#            the indexing process and will likely slow things down significantly.

# Uncomment the following line to index full text from URLs found in your MARC
# records.  All sorts of document formats are supported (PDF, Word Doc, ASCII
# text, HTML, etc.) The first parameter is a fieldspec showing which fields to use
# for URL retrieval.  The second parameter is optional -- if included, only files
# matching the specified suffix will be indexed.  Note that this functionality
# depends on a full text tool being installed on your system.  See the wiki for

# If you have records using a different 773 format, you may need to write a custom
# indexing script to parse out volume/issue/number.
# Additionally, you will need to make sure articles have a format value of "Article."
# If all of your records are articles, you can hard-code this using:
#format = "Article"
# ...but if you need to distinguish between articles and non-articles, you will need
# to build a custom getFormat routine.
