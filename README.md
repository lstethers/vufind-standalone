This repository provides instructions and customized files to install VuFind on a Windows PC, harvest Marc records from Alma, and then run as a standalone catalog not requiring any network access.

We use this method to provide a searchable catalog of our Alma records on laptops to students in a prison environment where no network access is permitted.

Follow the installation and record harvesting instructions in "How to install VuFind for standalone catalog.pdf"
