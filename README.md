# vufind-standalone
INSTALL: 
Follow the installation and record harvesting instructions in "How to install VuFind for standalone catalog.pdf"

ABOUT: 
This repository provides instructions and customized files to install VuFind on a Windows PC, harvest Marc records from Alma, and then run as a standalone catalog not requiring any network access.

We use this method to provide a searchable catalog of our Alma records on laptops to students in a prison environment where no network access is permitted.

The files in this repository contain only those files changed from the default VuFind installation. Changes from the default file contents are indicated with comments beginning with "VUFINDLOCALONLY".

This setup is not perfect and there may be better ways to accomplish these customizations in VuFind. I welcome your suggestions and questions, please contact me!
